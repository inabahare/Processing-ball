# Processing Ball
This is just for myself so that I can remember what happens

# Methods
All the ones prefixed with "set" are to be used when

### .setstart(startX, startY)
I think this one gives itself away. Sets the startposision according to the variables passed. Both are floats.

### .setVel(startVelX, startVelY)
Sets the start velocity

### . setSize(diameter)
Set the size of the circle
